# Notes:
# 1) Install the plugin as a dev dependency: npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs
# 2) Add required ENV variables in Netlify site settings: API_URL, PROXY_BACKEND_PREFIX, PROXY_ALLOWLIST, etc.
# 3) If you rely on SSR/middleware/API routes ensure you have the plugin installed so Netlify can convert server code to functions/edge functions.
